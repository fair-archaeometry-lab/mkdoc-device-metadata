# Metadata Profiles for Analytical Devices in Archaeometry

The content of this documentation site displays the research output of a temporary working group [Metadata profiles for analytical methods in Archaeometry](https://zenodo.org/records/10990411) within the framework of [NFDI4Objects](https://www.nfdi4objects.net/). 

The profiles are meant to describe instrument parameters that are used to control experiments, might
influence subsequent interpretations and/or will be important for data comparison and discovery. Different versions of profiles are archives in this site, as they are based on community effort and receive constant modification and improvement. 

The schemas are designed in two ways: (1) human-readable HTML and (2) machine-readable format.  



## Human-Readable HTML

The profile is organised in a MarkDown file, with each term containing the following properties:  

* `Preferred label` - A label that serves as the user-facing term to identify a concept. 
* `Definition` - The description of a concept to explain what it is about.
* `Data type` - Build the documentation site.
* `Obligation` - Print help message and exit.
* `Occurrences` - Print help message and exit.
* `Allowed values` - Print help message and exit.
* `Reference` - Print help message and exit.
* `Comments` - Print help message and exit.
* `Example` - Print help message and exit.
